Had issues dynamically adding buttons to my website. Tried JQuery and vanilla JavaScript but was unable to get it working. The value flashes in my console log and the button as well on my page. Not sure why it didnt work. First tried on click evebt handler but swithced to .submit and was able to grab value.
